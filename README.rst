Next Gen Storage project
========================

The sole purpose of this repo is to provide a bit of a structure for
next-gen-storage project. Just to provide a way to synchronize
different repositories (e.g. linux, qemu, potentially open-zfs) and a
storage for necessary config files and helper scripts.
